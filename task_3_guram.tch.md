# Simple Naive Bayes Spam Filter

## 1. What This Project Does

This folder implements a compact demonstration of a spam filter using classical machine learning:

- Input: short email‑style messages.
- Output: label `spam` or `ham` (legitimate).
- Model: bag‑of‑words features using `CountVectorizer` and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

The goal is to show the full workflow for text classification rather than to build a production‑grade system.

## 2. Repository Contents

- `task3.py` – Python script that builds the dataset, trains the classifier, evaluates it, and produces a visualisation.
- `length_histogram.png` – histogram of message lengths by class, generated by the script.
- `README.md` – how to use and understand this mini‑project.
